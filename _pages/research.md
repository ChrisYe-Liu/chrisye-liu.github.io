<h4><font  color=blue size=3><b>ChirpBox: An Infrastructure-Less LoRa Testbed</b></font></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
A key obstacle hindering the development of large-scale LoRa testbeds outdoors is the lack of a backbone infrastructure allowing them to communicate with the nodes and supply them with power easily. As a result, many LoRa installations are deployed indoors or only support a handful of outdoor devices, which does not allow proper testing. To bridge this gap, we built ChirpBox, an infrastructure-less LoRa testbed. ChirpBox is <b>open source</b>, and the <font  color=red ><b>tutorial website </b></font>can be found at <a href="https://chirpbox.github.io/" target="_blank">[Link]</a>.

<h4><font  color=blue size=3><b>Dependable Wireless Network Protocols for IoT</b></font></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Wireless networking in the Internet of Things is challenging because massive of devices in a relatively small region need to be interconnected. Particularly, the CSMA/CA operation is not a viable solution since a dense network leads to high channel contentions. Moreover, external radio interference can indeed undermine network dependability. Thus, we proposed and implemented protocols to address this challenge. This research work was supported by NSFC.

<h4><font  color=blue size=3><b>On-Demand Railway Bridge Structural Health Monitoring</b></font></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Over 73,000 railway bridges are older than 110 years in Europe. The IoT is promising for railway bridge health monitoring. However, existing energy-efficient approaches, such as duty cycling and energy harvesting, face challenges in this application due to the unpredictability of train passages and insufficient ambient energy around bridges. We proposed EocVibe, the first railway bridge monitoring IoT system that provides on-demand sensing with near-zero idle energy dissipation. This research work was supported by VINNOVA.

<h4><font  color=blue size=3><b>Harvest Energy from Water: A Green Water Quality Sensing System</b></font></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Water quality data is crucial and valuable, but its acquisition is not always trivial. A promising solution is to distribute a wireless sensor network in water to measure and collect the data. However, a drawback exists in that the system's batteries must be replaced or recharged after being exhausted. To mitigate this issue, we designed a self-sustained and on-demand water quality sensing system powered by renewable bioenergy from microbial fuel cells. This research work was supported by the Exploratory Advanced Research Program of FHWA.
