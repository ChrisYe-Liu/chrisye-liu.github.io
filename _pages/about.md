About Me
------
I am currently working at Nanjing Agricultural University. Before that, I was a Macao Young Scholar in the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology between 2022 and 2024. I received the Ph.D. degree from the School of Electronic Science & Engineering, Southeast University, in 2018. During my Ph.D. period, I was a Visiting Scholar with Montana State University from October 2014 to October 2015, supervised by [Dr. Qing Yang](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~qingyang/), and a Joint Ph.D. Student from February 2017 to January 2018 with the Networked Embedded Systems Group, RISE Swedish Institute of Computer Science, supervised by [Prof. Thiemo Voigt](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N2-279).
